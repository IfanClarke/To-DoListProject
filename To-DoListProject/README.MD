Project Title
To-Do List

This is a To-Do List app so people can create tasks and subtasks. You are able to create, read, update and delete tasks and subtasks. Those tasks take a task name, description, priority and deadline.

Getting Started
Open a command line. Navigate into the To-Do List folder and then the target folder and write java -jar ims-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar to open the server. Then run the front-end on LiveServer to see the front end of the app.

Prerequisites
Java to run the jar and LiveServer to run the front end

Installing
Download the folder. Run the java jar to get the server running.
 
Unit Tests
Unit tests test small parts of the source code at once. In this case all the classes are tested.

Integration Tests
Integration tests test bigger parts of the code than unit tests. I have run service integration tests

Built With
Spring Boot
Maven - Dependency Management
HTML, CSS and Javascript
